## Description

Implement expense categories that admins can create, edit, and delete. Categories are organization-scoped and have name and optional description.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] ExpenseCategory model with name, description, organizationId
- [x] CRUD operations for categories (admin-only)
- [x] Categories are organization-scoped
- [x] UI for managing categories
- [x] Proper authorization (only org admins can manage categories)

## TODOs

- [x] Create ExpenseCategory model in Prisma schema
- [x] Create category tRPC procedures
  - create, update, delete (admin-only)
  - list (members can view)
- [x] Build category management UI
- [x] Add to organization settings/admin panel
- [x] Write tests for category operations

## Notes

Simple CRUD functionality. Categories will be used by policies and expenses in later tasks.

## Implementation Summary

**Database Changes:**
- Added `ExpenseCategory` model with fields: id, name, description, organizationId, createdAt, updatedAt
- Established relationship with Organization model
- Unique constraint on (name, organizationId) to prevent duplicate category names per organization
- Created migration: `20250914224947_add_expense_categories`

**API Implementation:**
- Created `categoryRouter` with 5 procedures:
  - `create`: Admin-only category creation with name validation
  - `update`: Admin-only category updates with conflict checking
  - `delete`: Admin-only category deletion
  - `list`: Organization members can view categories (sorted alphabetically)
  - `getById`: Get single category details for organization members
- Proper authorization using existing `requireOrgAdmin` and `requireOrgMembership` helpers
- Input validation with Zod schemas (name max 100 chars, optional description)

**UI Components:**
- `CategoryForm`: Reusable form component for creating/editing categories
- `CategoryList`: Management interface showing all categories with admin controls
- Integrated into organization details page alongside other admin features
- Responsive design with loading states and error handling

**Features Delivered:**
- Organization-scoped categories (isolated per organization)
- Role-based access control (Admins: full CRUD, Members: read-only)
- Name uniqueness validation within organizations
- Optional description field for additional context
- Real-time UI updates after operations
- User-friendly confirmation dialogs for deletions

**Testing:**
- Comprehensive test suite with 14 test cases covering:
  - All CRUD operations with success scenarios
  - Authorization edge cases (non-admin, non-member)
  - Data validation (duplicate names, missing categories)
  - Proper error handling
- All tests passing with transactional testing setup

**Code Quality:**
- ESLint compliance with no warnings or errors
- TypeScript compilation without issues
- Proper type safety throughout the implementation
- Consistent with project patterns and conventions
