## Description

Build upon the existing T3 Stack foundation to implement core organization management functionality. Replace the placeholder "post" model/router/components with organization creation and management, including proper multi-tenant authorization patterns.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Database schema extended with Organization and Membership models
- [x] Organization tRPC router implemented with CRUD operations
- [x] UI pages/components for listing and creating organizations
- [x] Basic authorization utilities for org membership and admin checks
- [x] Organization update functionality with admin-only access
- [x] All tests passing and code quality checks (pnpm run check) passing
- [x] Post-related code can be safely removed as reference implementation

## TODOs

- [x] Extend Prisma schema with Organization and Membership models
  - Organization: id, name, createdAt, updatedAt, createdById
  - Membership: userId, organizationId, role (ADMIN/MEMBER), joinedAt
  - Add proper relationships and indexes
- [x] Create and run database migration
- [x] Create organization tRPC router (~/server/api/routers/organization.ts)
  - create: Create new organization (user becomes admin)
  - list: List user's organizations with role info
  - getById: Get organization details (members only)
  - update: Update organization (admins only)
- [x] Add organization router to app router
- [x] Create authorization utilities for reuse
  - requireOrgMembership(userId, orgId)
  - requireOrgAdmin(userId, orgId)
- [x] Build organization UI components
  - OrganizationList: List user's organizations
  - CreateOrganization: Form to create new organization
  - UpdateOrganization: Form to update organization (admins only)
  - OrganizationDetails: Client component with reactive updates
- [x] Create organization pages
  - /organizations: List user's organizations
  - /organizations/new: Create new organization
  - /organizations/[id]: Organization details/settings
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for router and authorization
- [x] Set up environment variables (.env from .env.example)
- [x] Ensure pnpm run check passes
- [x] Remove post router, components, and references

## Progress Updates

### 2025-09-14 - Initial Planning

**Status**: Not Started
**Progress**: Analyzed existing codebase - T3 Stack already set up with NextAuth, Prisma, tRPC. Post model/router/components exist as reference implementation.
**Blockers**: Need .env setup for code quality checks
**Next Steps**: Extend database schema with Organization/Membership models

### 2025-09-14 - Implementation Complete

**Status**: Completed
**Progress**: Successfully implemented complete organization management foundation including:
- Database schema with Organization, Membership models and Role enum
- Full tRPC router with CRUD operations and proper authorization
- Authorization utilities (requireOrgMembership, requireOrgAdmin)
- Complete UI components with reactive updates and server-side hydration
- Comprehensive test suite (18 tests passing)
- Migration squashed to single "initialize-db" migration
- Post-related code completely removed
**Issues Resolved**:
- Fixed organization name update not reflecting in UI (converted to client components with useSuspenseQuery)
- Fixed server-side hydration with proper prefetch + HydrateClient pattern
- Fixed all linting errors and TypeScript strict mode issues
**Deliverables**: Ready for TASK-002 (User Invitations System)

## Completion Checklist

- [x] All acceptance criteria met
- [x] Code follows project standards
- [x] Tests written and passing (18/18 tests pass)
- [x] pnpm run check passes (no ESLint warnings or TypeScript errors)
- [x] Code review completed

## Notes

### Final Implementation Status:

- ✅ **Complete Organization Management System**: Full CRUD operations with proper authorization
- ✅ **Multi-tenant Architecture**: Organization-scoped data isolation with Role-based access control
- ✅ **Database Foundation**: Organization, Membership models with proper relationships and indexes
- ✅ **Authorization Patterns**: Reusable utilities (requireOrgMembership, requireOrgAdmin)
- ✅ **Reactive UI**: Client components with server-side hydration and real-time updates
- ✅ **Comprehensive Testing**: 18 tests covering routers and authorization utilities
- ✅ **Production Ready**: All code quality checks passing, no linting errors
- ✅ **Clean Migration**: Single "initialize-db" migration, post-related code removed

### Key Technical Achievements:
- **Server-side Hydration**: Proper prefetch + useSuspenseQuery pattern for instant loading
- **Reactive Updates**: Organization name changes immediately reflect in UI without page reload
- **Authorization Security**: Robust multi-tenant data isolation and role-based permissions
- **Test Coverage**: Full test suite with transactional testing for database operations

### Ready for Next Phase:
The foundation is now ready for **TASK-002 (User Invitations System)** which will build upon these organization management patterns to enable team collaboration and multi-user testing.
