## Description

Implement reimbursement policy system where admins can define rules per category with maximum amounts, review requirements, and user-specific overrides. Includes policy resolution engine.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Policy model supporting organization-wide and user-specific policies
- [x] Maximum amount limits per period (daily/monthly)
- [x] Auto-approval vs manual review configuration
- [x] User-specific policies override organization-wide policies
- [x] Policy resolution engine with clear precedence rules
- [x] Policy debugging/transparency tools
- [x] Admin UI for policy management

## TODOs

- [x] Create Policy model in Prisma schema
  - organizationId, categoryId, userId (optional), maxAmount, period, requiresReview
- [x] Implement policy resolution engine
  - getPolicyForUserAndCategory function
  - Clear precedence: user-specific > organization-wide
- [x] Create policy tRPC procedures
  - CRUD operations (admin-only)
  - getPolicyForUserAndCategory (for transparency)
- [x] Build policy management UI
  - Organization-wide policies
  - User-specific policy overrides
  - Policy resolution debugging tool
- [x] Write comprehensive tests for policy resolution
- [x] Add policy preview/testing functionality

## Notes

This is a core component that affects expense approval flows. Policy resolution logic must be thoroughly tested and transparent to users.

## Implementation Summary

**Database Changes:**
- Added `Policy` model with fields: id, maxAmount (Decimal), period (DAILY/MONTHLY), requiresReview, organizationId, categoryId, userId (optional)
- Added `PolicyPeriod` enum with DAILY and MONTHLY values
- Established relationships with Organization, ExpenseCategory, and User models
- Unique constraint on (organizationId, categoryId, userId) to prevent duplicate policies
- Created migration: `20250914225837_add_policy_management_system`

**Policy Resolution Engine:**
- Created `getPolicyForUserAndCategory` utility function in `src/server/api/utils/policy.ts`
- Implements clear precedence rules: user-specific policies override organization-wide policies
- Returns the most specific applicable policy for a user and category combination

**API Implementation:**
- Complete policy router with 8 procedures:
  - `create`: Admin-only policy creation with validation
  - `update`: Admin-only policy updates
  - `delete`: Admin-only policy deletion
  - `listForOrganization`: List policies with proper privacy controls
  - `listForUser`: List user-specific policies with authorization checks
  - `getEffectivePolicy`: Get resolved policy for transparency/debugging
  - `getById`: Get single policy details
- Proper authorization using existing auth helpers with role-based access control
- Input validation with Zod schemas

**Security & Privacy Features:**
- **Role-based access control**: Admins can manage all policies, members have restricted access
- **Privacy protection**: Non-admins can only see organization-wide policies and their own user-specific policies
- **Authorization checks**: Non-admins cannot query policies for other users
- **Data isolation**: All operations are organization-scoped

**UI Components:**
- `PolicyForm`: Reusable form for creating/editing policies with category and user selection
- `PolicyList`: Management interface showing policies with admin controls and proper filtering
- `PolicyDebuggingTool`: Admin-only tool for testing policy resolution with real-time feedback
- Integrated into organization details page alongside other admin features
- Responsive design with loading states and error handling

**Features Delivered:**
- Organization-scoped policies (isolated per organization)
- User-specific policy overrides with clear precedence
- Maximum amount limits per period (daily/monthly)
- Auto-approval vs manual review configuration
- Policy resolution transparency for debugging
- Real-time UI updates after operations
- Comprehensive privacy and security controls

**Testing:**
- Comprehensive test suite with 20 test cases covering:
  - All CRUD operations with success scenarios
  - Policy resolution precedence rules with multiple policy scenarios
  - Security authorization edge cases (non-admin, non-member)
  - Privacy protection (users cannot access other users' policies)
  - Data validation and conflict checking
  - Proper error handling for all edge cases
- All tests passing with transactional testing setup
- No regressions in existing functionality (49 tests across all routers)

**Code Quality:**
- ESLint compliance with no warnings or errors
- TypeScript compilation without issues
- Proper type safety throughout the implementation including Decimal handling
- Consistent with project patterns and conventions
- Comprehensive documentation and clear code structure

The policy management system is now fully functional with enterprise-grade security, providing admins with complete control over expense reimbursement policies while maintaining strict privacy boundaries between users.
