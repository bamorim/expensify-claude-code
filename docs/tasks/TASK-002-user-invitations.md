## Description

Implement simplified user invitation system where admins can invite users by email address. Instead of sending real emails, invitation links are logged to console, and logged-in users can see pending invitations for their email address.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [x] Admins can create invitations by entering email addresses
- [x] Invitation links logged to console for development
- [x] Logged-in users can view pending invitations for their email
- [x] Users can accept invitations and join organizations
- [x] Invitation management UI for admins (pending/accepted status)
- [x] Proper authorization (only admins can invite to their orgs)

## TODOs

- [x] Create Invitation model in Prisma schema
  - id, email, organizationId, invitedById, role, status, token, createdAt, expiresAt
- [x] Create invitation tRPC procedures
  - create: Create invitation (admins only)
  - listPendingForUser: Get pending invitations for current user's email
  - accept: Accept invitation and create membership
  - listForOrg: List organization's invitations (admins only)
- [x] Build invitation UI components
  - InviteUser: Form for admins to invite by email
  - PendingInvitations: List for users to see their pending invites
  - OrganizationInvitations: Admin view of org's invitations
- [x] Add invitation acceptance flow
- [x] Console logging for invitation links
- [x] Write tests for invitation system

## Notes

This simplified approach avoids email configuration complexity while maintaining full invitation functionality for development and testing.

## Implementation Summary

**Database Changes:**
- Added `Invitation` model with proper relationships to User and Organization
- Added `InvitationStatus` enum (PENDING, ACCEPTED, EXPIRED)
- Created migration: `20250914223345_add_invitation_system`

**API Implementation:**
- Created `invitationRouter` with 4 procedures:
  - `create`: Admin-only invitation creation with email validation

  - `accept`: Token-based invitation acceptance with membership creation
  - `listForOrg`: Admin view of organization invitations
- Proper authorization using existing `requireOrgAdmin` helper
- Console logging of invitation links for development

**UI Components:**
- `InviteUser`: Admin form for sending invitations
- `PendingInvitations`: User dashboard for accepting invites
- `OrganizationInvitations`: Admin view of org invitation status
- `InviteAcceptance`: Dedicated page for invitation links (`/invite/[token]`)
- Integrated components into existing organization pages
