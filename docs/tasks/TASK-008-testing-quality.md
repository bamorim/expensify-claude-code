## Description

Ensure comprehensive test coverage across all features, establish code quality standards, and set up proper CI/CD checks. Focus on testing business logic, authorization, and multi-tenant data isolation.

## Acceptance Criteria

- [ ] Unit tests for all tRPC procedures
- [ ] Integration tests for complex workflows
- [ ] Authorization tests ensuring proper data isolation
- [ ] Policy engine tests with edge cases
- [ ] Component tests for critical UI flows
- [ ] 90%+ test coverage on business logic
- [ ] All code quality checks passing
- [ ] Performance tests for key operations

## TODOs

- [ ] Set up test database configuration
- [ ] Write comprehensive router tests
  - Organization CRUD and authorization
  - Invitation flows
  - Policy resolution engine
  - Expense submission and review
- [ ] Test multi-tenant data isolation
- [ ] Write integration tests for complete workflows
- [ ] Add component tests for forms and dashboards
- [ ] Set up test data factories using @faker-js/faker
- [ ] Configure test coverage reporting
- [ ] Add performance benchmarks
- [ ] Document testing patterns and guidelines
- [ ] Set up pre-commit hooks for quality checks

## Notes

Testing strategy focuses on business logic in tRPC procedures using transactional testing. UI tests cover critical user flows but prioritize backend testing for reliability.
